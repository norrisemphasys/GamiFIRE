    covers most of the costs, there are still additional expenses for prescriptions,
    specialized treatments, and time off work. How do you handle it?

  - answer: I check if my employer offers health-related benefits, paid sick leave,
      or financial assistance programs. If the situation affects my long-term ability
      to work, I explore vocational training or career counseling to adapt my skills.
