  questionTitle: Building an Emergency Fund
  question: "You realize that your savings are insufficient to cover unexpected expenses.
    You want to start an emergency fund. What\u2019s your approach?"

  - answer: Automate savings by setting up a separate account with recurring transfers
      of a small, manageable amount from your paycheck. Combine this with creative
      strategies like selling unused items, cashback apps, or participating in community
      swap programs to save money in unique ways.

  - answer: Dedicate a fixed percentage of your monthly income to the emergency fund
      and invest in low-risk, short-term financial instruments (e.g., money market
      accounts) to grow your savings. Consider temporary gig work or part-time roles
      to accelerate the process.
