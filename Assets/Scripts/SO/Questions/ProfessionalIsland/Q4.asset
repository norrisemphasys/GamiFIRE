  - answer: 'Split the bonus into three parts: invest a portion in a high-yield savings

      for a meaningful but modest treat, balancing financial growth and personal
      enjoyment.'

  - answer: "Pay down high-interest debt first to reduce long-term financial burdens
      and free up more disposable income in the future. If you\u2019re debt-free,
      invest the entire bonus in assets that can grow, such as stocks or a retirement
      fund."
